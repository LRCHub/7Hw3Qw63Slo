I am the passenger and I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah the bright and hollow sky
You know it looks so good tonight
I am the passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
Singing la la la la lalalala
La la la la lalalala la la

We get into the car
We'll be the passenger
We'll ride through the city tonight
We'll see the city's ripped backside
We'll see the bright and hollow sky
We'll see the stars that shine so bright
You know it looks so good tonight
Singing la la la la lalalala
La la la la lalalala la la

Oh the passenger
Oh how he rides
Oh the passenger
He rides and he rides

He looks through his window
What does he see?
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the stars come out tonight
He sees the city's ripped backsides
And everything was made for you and me
So let's take a ride
And see what's mine
Singing la la la la lalalala
La la la la lalalala
La la la la lalalala la la
