[00:20.95] I am the passenger
[00:24.64] And I ride and I ride
[00:28.09] I ride through the city's backsides
[00:31.54] I see the stars come out of the sky
[00:35.11] Yeah, the bright and hollow sky
[00:38.59] You know it looks so good tonight
[00:55.09] 
[00:49.05] I am the passenger
[00:52.52] I stay under glass
[00:56.02] I look through my window so bright
[00:59.44] I see the stars come out tonight
[01:03.08] I see the bright and hollow sky
[01:06.45] Over the city's ripped backsides
[01:22.45] 
[01:09.98] And everything looks good tonight
[01:26.48] 
[01:19.05] Singing
[01:19.94] La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
[01:23.49] La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
[01:26.89] La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
[01:44.39] 
[01:37.45] Get into the car
[01:41.04] We'll be the passenger
[01:44.31] We'll ride through the city tonight
[01:47.93] We'll see the city's ripped backsides
[01:51.46] We'll see the bright and hollow sky
[01:54.85] We'll see the stars that shine so bright
[01:58.25] Stars made for us tonight
[02:10.75] 
[02:08.50] Oh, the passenger
[02:12.06] How, how he rides?
[02:15.50] Oh, the passenger
[02:19.09] He rides and he rides
[02:22.36] He looks through his window
[02:25.88] What does he see?
[02:34.38] 
[02:29.27] He sees the sign and hollow sky
[02:32.62] He sees the stars come out tonight
[02:36.02] He sees the city's ripped backsides
[02:39.37] He sees the winding ocean drive
[02:54.87] 
[02:42.86] And everything was made for you and me
[02:46.24] All of it was made for you and me
[02:49.76] 'Cause it just belongs to you and me
[02:53.01] So let's take a ride and see what's mine

[03:23.84] He rides and he rides
[03:27.00] He sees things from under glass
[03:30.58] He looks through his window side
[03:46.58] 
[03:33.94] He sees things he knows are his
[03:37.39] He sees the bright and hollow sky
[03:40.73] He sees the city sleep at night
[03:44.18] He sees the stars are out tonight
[04:00.68] 
[03:47.51] And all of it is yours and mine
[03:50.96] And all of it is yours and mine
[03:54.35] So let's ride and ride and ride and ride
